# Hangman Game (Python)

This is a simple Hangman game I made using Python as part of my internship task.  
It runs in the terminal and allows the user to guess a randomly selected word letter by letter.

## 📌 What the Game Does

- The program selects a word from a small list.
- You get **6 chances** to guess the word.
- You need to type one letter at a time.
- If the letter is in the word, it will be shown in the correct position.
- If not, your number of tries will reduce.
- The game ends when you guess the full word or run out of tries.
